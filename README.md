## Setup

Use JKSV on a Switch running Atmosphere to restore the .zip from Releases page to the console, then use the official save transfer between consoles functionality to transfer it to Switch 2.

You need one Nintendo account connected to both consoles.

It's also possible to use ns2jb with RPC to open the save and upload the files, but at time of writing not yet tested.

## Updating

The launcher has a fail-safe update mechanism implemented.

The following core scripts can be updated by writing a script named `<name>2.lua`:
- `core.lua`
- `http.lua`
- `inject.lua`

In case something goes wrong you can just hold the `-` (minus) button on the controller during startup to load the original scripts.

## Interacting with HTTP server

```
$ curl -X POST http://CONSOLE_IP:8080/eval -d 'print("hello world")'

status: ok
output:
hello world
```

```
$ curl -X PUT --data-binary @file.bin "http://CONSOLE_IP:8080/save?path=save:/file.bin"
```

```
$ curl -X DELETE http://CONSOLE_IP:8080/delete?path=save:/file.bin
```

## How to update

Two options:

1. Either remake the save using the usual means (transfer or other entrypoint).

2. Use the HTTP way of upgrading:

```
$ curl -X PUT --data-binary @GAME_HERE/core.lua "http://CONSOLE_IP:8080/save?path=save:/core2.lua"
$ curl -X PUT --data-binary @common/http.lua "http://CONSOLE_IP:8080/save?path=save:/http2.lua"
$ curl -X PUT --data-binary @common/inject.lua "http://CONSOLE_IP:8080/save?path=save:/inject2.lua"
```

## FAQ

### Is it an entry point like Smilebasic 4?

Not really, this is intended to be used for convenient one-click launch of any upcoming exploit (some would call this "semi-tethered"), after you get the launcher save onto your Switch 2.

Whenever the 23.0.1 FS exploit window closes your only option to get the save on the device will be using an FS exploit triggered with another game that doesn't require a modified save, eg. Smilebasic 4 or [Civilization 7 1.0.0](https://github.com/Gezine/CivSwitch) or any other yet to be disclosed game.

### I've grabbed the full version, is it supported?

Not yet, I told you to grab the demos :(

### I missed my opportunity to grab the demos above and they're pulled from eShop!

You still can get those, though not yet supported:

- `01002eb00ce48000` - Nora Princess and Stray Cat HD **Demo** https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000012253
